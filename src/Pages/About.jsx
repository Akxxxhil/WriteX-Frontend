            <p className='text-xl font-semibold'>WriteX is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; WriteX is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for whatever you have to say.</p> <br />

            <p className='text-xl font-semibold'>We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.</p><br />

            <p className='text-xl font-semibold'>Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the power of writing.</p><br />
